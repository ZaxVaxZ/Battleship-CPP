### The game has smart logic for piece placements, showing only the possible direction options, or immediately placing the piece if it only has 1 valid direction, handling invalid input otherwise.

### The game proceeds with the user inputting the coordinates of where to attack the opponents map, then showing the opponent's attacks and current reveal map of the player. The game automatically ticks off all invalid squares as per the rules of the game and the placement of the ships.
